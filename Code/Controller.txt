The robot is controlled using RemoteXY, an app available on Android and ios used to control Arduino-like projects, including esp32's Bluetooth capability.

The following code is what made controlling possible: 

#define REMOTEXY_MODE__ESP32CORE_BLUETOOTH
#include <BluetoothSerial.h>
#define REMOTEXY_BLUETOOTH_NAME "NATUS"
#include <RemoteXY.h>
#pragma pack(push, 1)  
uint8_t RemoteXY_CONF[] =  
  { 255,4,0,0,0,70,0,18,0,0,0,31,1,106,200,1,1,4,0,1,
  64,29,36,36,4,63,31,70,111,114,119,97,114,100,0,1,8,29,36,36,
  4,63,31,66,97,99,107,0,1,61,118,38,38,4,12,31,70,111,114,119,
  97,114,100,0,1,6,118,39,39,4,12,31,66,97,99,107,0 };
struct {
  uint8_t button_01;
  uint8_t button_02; 
  uint8_t button_03; 
  uint8_t button_04; 
  uint8_t connect_flag; 
} RemoteXY;   
#pragma pack(pop)

The control buttons can be edited on RemoteXY website: (https://remotexy.com/en/editor/) and from there copy a new code into the previous one's place.
